## Diary Entry: Week of 18th - 24th September 2023

This week was dedicated to writing a first draft of the abstract for my project PKCS#1 v1.5 digital signature scheme for my project and researching arbitrary precision arithmetic for I library I may look to implement as part of the aims for the project

On Monday, I started writing about its importance, touching on its widespread use and history. Tuesday was a continuation, emphasising why it's such a vital system.

By Wednesday, I added details on potential security issues, particularly focusing on something called the Bleichenbacher attacks. I was initially puzzled about how these attacks affected the signature scheme.

On Thursday and Friday, after more research, I figured out the difference between how these attacks affect encryption and signature aspects of the system. This helped clarify some of my earlier confusion.

Over the weekend, I added insights on why, despite some concerns, many still prefer the PKCS system. I also touched upon a new research finding that supports its use. By Sunday, I detailed my main goals for this project, hoping to create a useful tool that compares different signature schemes.

Next I will clarify whether I should consider implementing a self-made big number library as part of the project and hopefully advance significantly in the creation of the project plan.
