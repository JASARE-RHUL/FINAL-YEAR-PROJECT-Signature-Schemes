## Diary Entry: Week of 18th - 24th September 2023

This week was dedicated to writing a first draft of the abstract for my project PKCS#1 v1.5 digital signature scheme for my project and researching arbitrary precision arithmetic for I library I may look to implement as part of the aims for the project

On Monday, I started writing about its importance, touching on its widespread use and history. Tuesday was a continuation, emphasising why it's such a vital system.

By Wednesday, I added details on potential security issues, particularly focusing on something called the Bleichenbacher attacks. I was initially puzzled about how these attacks affected the signature scheme.

On Thursday and Friday, after more research, I figured out the difference between how these attacks affect encryption and signature aspects of the system. This helped clarify some of my earlier confusion.

Over the weekend, I added insights on why, despite some concerns, many still prefer the PKCS system. I also touched upon a new research finding that supports its use. By Sunday, I detailed my main goals for this project, hoping to create a useful tool that compares different signature schemes.

Next I will clarify whether I should consider implementing a self-made big number library as part of the project and hopefully advance significantly in the creation of the project plan.




## Diary Entry - Week of 25th September - 1st October 2023

Met with my supervisor for initial meeting. Discussed potential extensions to the original project specifications and in general what the project entails. Refocused and refined the project plan, emphasising deterministic RSA hash-and-sign schemes, especially PKCS#1 v1.5. Made structural changes to the introduction and abstract, enhancing clarity. Set up the Maven project directory on GitLab and further developed the project timeline. Transitioned all documentation from Microsoft Word to latex, drafting the literature review in the process. By week's end, automated referencing in latex for enhanced efficiency.
